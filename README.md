# Logseq Trello Plugin (logseq-trello-plugin)

A seamless integration between Logseq and Trello that allows you to import Trello cards as Logseq pages and keep them in sync.

## Features

This plugin provides seamless integration between Logseq and Trello, allowing you to:

- Import Trello cards as Logseq pages with full content and formatting
- Track relationships between Logseq pages and Trello cards via automatic URL linking
- Preserve all card content including descriptions, comments, and metadata
- Support Unicode characters (including Chinese, Japanese, etc.)
- Smart version control to prevent conflicts:
  * Tracks changes on both Trello and Logseq sides
  * Only updates content when necessary
  * Preserves local edits when they're more recent

  * Prevents creating duplicate cards
  * Updates existing cards instead of creating new ones
  * Maintains consistent links between platforms
- Import content in clean, block-based format for easy editing
